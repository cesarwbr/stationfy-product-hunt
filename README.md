# Stationfy

Simulates Product Hunt application

## How it works?

I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run the server, ReactJS, Redux and JavaScript ES6.

## First steps

### 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### 2. Once Node.js installed, open up the terminal.

### 3. Navigate to the project folder:

```
$ cd stationfy-product-hunt
```

### 4. And finally run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You'll have access to the app at `localhost:8080`

## File structure

The basic file structure for the project is organized in the following way:

```
.
|-- __tests__
|-- js
    |-- actions
    |-- components
    |-- store
|-- public
    |-- img
|-- server
```

## Testsuite

The app uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to run the tests located in the `__test__/` folder. To run the tests:

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
